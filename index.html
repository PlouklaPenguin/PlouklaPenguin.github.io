                    Awen's first piece of art is by far the worst, <br> even though the dog is cute. 
                    It is simply far less <br> creative than all the other pieces of art. However, it is <br> Awen's first, so this can be forgiven.

                    This magnificent piece of art was created by

                    After creating his first rectangle, Awen decided
                    <br> that making another masterpiece would be a good idea.  
                    <br> A few paint buckets later, his latest creation was formed.
